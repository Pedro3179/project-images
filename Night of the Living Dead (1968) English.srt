1
00:02:57,428 --> 00:03:00,723
They ought to make the day the time changes
the first day of summer.

2
00:03:00,807 --> 00:03:03,518
- What?
- Well, it's eight o'clock and it's still light.

3
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:06,729
A lot of good the extra daylight does us.

4
00:03:06,813 --> 00:03:10,608
Now, we've still got a three-hour drive back.
We're not gonna be home until after midnight.

5
00:03:10,692 --> 00:03:13,319
Well, if it really bugged you, Johnny,
you wouldn't do it.

6
00:03:13,403 --> 00:03:16,447
You think I wanna blow Sunday
on a scene like this?

7
00:03:16,531 --> 00:03:19,242
You know, I figure we're either gonna
have to move Mother out here,

8
00:03:19,325 --> 00:03:21,244
or move the grave into Pittsburgh.

9
00:03:21,327 --> 00:03:25,498
- She can't make a trip like this.
- Oh, I don't know that she can't.

10
00:03:25,582 --> 00:03:28,042
Is there any of that candy left?

11
00:03:28,126 --> 00:03:29,377
No.

12
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:31,588
Look at this thing.
"We still remember."

13
00:03:31,671 --> 00:03:35,133
I don't. You know, I don't even remember
what the man looks like.

14
00:03:35,216 --> 00:03:37,176
Johnny, it takes you five minutes.

15
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:39,345
Yeah, five minutes
to put the wreath on the grave

16
00:03:39,429 --> 00:03:41,973
and six hours to drive back and forth.

17
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:43,391
Mother wants to remember,

18
00:03:43,474 --> 00:03:46,603
so we trot 200 miles into the country
and she stays at home.

19
00:03:46,686 --> 00:03:48,271
Well, we're here, John. All right?

20
00:03:50,231 --> 00:03:53,735
<i>Testing. Are we back on?</i>

21
00:03:53,818 --> 00:03:56,362
<i>Oh. Uh, ladies and gentlemen -</i>

22
00:03:56,446 --> 00:03:57,488
Hey, do -

23
00:03:57,572 --> 00:04:01,034
<i>we're coming back on the air after an
interruption due to technical probl -</i>

24
00:04:13,671 --> 00:04:16,841
There's nothing wrong with the radio.
Must've been the station.

25
00:04:16,925 --> 00:04:18,676
Which row is it in?

26
00:04:39,238 --> 00:04:41,157
Boy, there's no one around.

27
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:43,952
Well, it's late.
If you'd gotten up earlier...

28
00:04:44,035 --> 00:04:47,163
Oh, look, I already lost an hour's sleep
on the time change.

29
00:04:47,246 --> 00:04:50,333
I think you complain
just to hear yourself talk.

30
00:04:50,416 --> 00:04:52,085
There it is.

31
00:05:07,725 --> 00:05:10,436
I wonder what happened
to the one from last year.

32
00:05:11,354 --> 00:05:13,773
Each year we spend good money
on these things.

33
00:05:13,856 --> 00:05:16,484
We come out here,
and the one from last year is gone.

34
00:05:16,567 --> 00:05:21,406
Well, the flowers die, and the caretaker
or somebody takes them away.

35
00:05:21,489 --> 00:05:26,244
Yeah, a little spit and polish,
he can clean this up, sell it next year.

36
00:05:26,327 --> 00:05:29,247
Wonder how many times
we've bought the same one.

37
00:05:46,723 --> 00:05:49,767
Hey, come on, Barb.
Church was this morning, huh?

38
00:06:08,703 --> 00:06:11,372
Hey, I mean, praying's for church, huh?

39
00:06:11,456 --> 00:06:13,291
Come on.

40
00:06:13,374 --> 00:06:15,543
I haven't seen you in church lately.

41
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:20,006
Well, there's not much sense
in my going to church.

42
00:06:21,007 --> 00:06:24,719
Do you remember one time
when we were small, we were out here?

43
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:26,429
It was from right over there.

44
00:06:26,512 --> 00:06:28,431
I jumped out at you from behind a tree,

45
00:06:28,514 --> 00:06:31,434
and Grandpa got all excited,
and he shook his fist at me and he said,

46
00:06:31,517 --> 00:06:34,103
"Boy, you'll be damned to hell."

47
00:06:34,187 --> 00:06:36,814
Remember that? Right over there.

48
00:06:36,898 --> 00:06:39,901
You used to really be scared here.

49
00:06:39,984 --> 00:06:41,652
Johnny.

50
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,404
Hey, you're still afraid.

51
00:06:43,488 --> 00:06:45,490
Stop it now. I mean it.

52
00:06:49,202 --> 00:06:52,163
They're coming to get you, Barbra.

53
00:06:52,955 --> 00:06:55,083
Stop it! You're ignorant!

54
00:06:55,166 --> 00:06:58,086
They're coming for you, Barbra.

55
00:06:58,169 --> 00:07:00,671
Stop it.
You're acting like a child.

56
00:07:00,755 --> 00:07:02,715
They're coming for you.

57
00:07:02,799 --> 00:07:05,343
Look! There comes one of them now!

58
00:07:06,302 --> 00:07:08,513
- He'll hear you.
- Here he comes now.

59
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,640
- I'm getting out of here.
- Johnny!

60
00:07:18,106 --> 00:07:20,024
No!

61
00:07:21,067 --> 00:07:22,693
No! Johnny!

62
00:07:22,777 --> 00:07:24,862
Help me! Help!

63
00:14:33,457 --> 00:14:34,792
It's all right.

64
00:14:38,546 --> 00:14:40,464
Don't worry about him.
I can handle him.

65
00:14:40,548 --> 00:14:43,551
Probably be a lot more of them
as soon as they find out about us.

66
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:48,222
Truck is out of gas.

67
00:14:48,305 --> 00:14:50,266
This pump out here is locked.
Is there a key?

68
00:14:52,226 --> 00:14:55,813
We can try to get out of here
if we can get some gas. Is there a key?

69
00:15:05,155 --> 00:15:07,157
I suppose you've tried this.

70
00:15:17,042 --> 00:15:18,794
Do you live here?

71
00:15:31,515 --> 00:15:33,392
Jesus.

72
00:15:41,775 --> 00:15:43,694
We've gotta get out of here.

73
00:15:43,777 --> 00:15:46,155
We have to get to where
there are some other people.

74
00:15:49,408 --> 00:15:51,994
M-Maybe we better take some food.

75
00:15:52,077 --> 00:15:54,371
I'll see if I can find some food.

76
00:16:38,916 --> 00:16:41,794
- What's happening?
- I'll be just a second.

77
00:16:42,795 --> 00:16:44,004
What's happening?

78
00:16:57,643 --> 00:16:59,228
Two of them.

79
00:17:04,316 --> 00:17:07,111
There are two of them out there.
Have you seen any more around here?

80
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:09,655
- I can take care of those two.
- I don't know. I don't know.

81
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,783
- I know you're afraid, but we have to -
- I don't know! I don't know!

82
00:17:12,866 --> 00:17:16,286
What's happening?

83
00:19:34,216 --> 00:19:36,051
They know we're in here now.

84
00:19:51,108 --> 00:19:52,526
Don't look at it.

85
00:21:05,682 --> 00:21:08,101
Get some more lights on in this house.

86
00:21:45,639 --> 00:21:48,558
Why don't you see if you can find some wood,
some boards, something there by the fireplace,

87
00:21:48,642 --> 00:21:50,644
something we can nail this place up.

88
00:21:55,524 --> 00:21:57,150
Look, goddamn it -

89
00:21:59,736 --> 00:22:03,198
Look. I know you're afraid.

90
00:22:03,281 --> 00:22:05,367
I'm afraid too.

91
00:22:05,450 --> 00:22:08,078
But we have to try to
board the house up together.

92
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:11,373
Now, I'm going to board up the windows
and the doors. Do you understand?

93
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:13,000
We'll be all right here.

94
00:22:13,083 --> 00:22:15,711
We'll be all right here
till someone comes to rescue us.

95
00:22:15,794 --> 00:22:17,713
But we have to work together.
You'll have to help me.

96
00:22:17,796 --> 00:22:20,716
Now, go in and get some wood
so I can board the place up.

97
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,093
Do you understand? Okay?

98
00:22:23,844 --> 00:22:25,345
Okay?

99
00:25:03,837 --> 00:25:06,548
That'll hold 'em.
Those things aren't that strong.

100
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:10,093
Here, I want you to pick out some nails.
Pick out the biggest ones you can find.

101
00:25:15,265 --> 00:25:17,267
There. This room looks pretty secure.

102
00:25:20,228 --> 00:25:23,231
If we have to, we can run in here
and board up the doors.

103
00:25:25,942 --> 00:25:30,447
Won't be long before those things'll be back,
pounding their way in here. They're afraid now.

104
00:25:34,534 --> 00:25:36,912
They're afraid of fire.
I found that out.

105
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:52,302
You know a place back down the road
called Beekman's? Beekman's Diner?

106
00:25:59,935 --> 00:26:03,063
Anyhow, that's where I found that truck
I have out there.

107
00:26:05,148 --> 00:26:07,150
There's a radio in the truck.

108
00:26:08,276 --> 00:26:10,403
I had jumped in to listen to it...

109
00:26:11,196 --> 00:26:14,616
when a big gasoline truck
came screaming right across the road.

110
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:19,079
Well, there must have been
10, 15 of those things chasing after it,

111
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,040
grabbing and holding on.

112
00:26:25,335 --> 00:26:27,337
I didn't see them at first.

113
00:26:28,922 --> 00:26:32,342
I could just see that the truck
was moving in a funny way.

114
00:26:33,134 --> 00:26:35,136
And those things were catching up to it.

115
00:26:38,056 --> 00:26:40,767
Truck went right across the road.

116
00:26:42,185 --> 00:26:45,522
Slammed on my brakes
to keep from hitting it myself.

117
00:26:45,605 --> 00:26:47,607
It went right through the guardrail.

118
00:26:52,487 --> 00:26:54,406
I guess -

119
00:26:54,489 --> 00:26:57,993
I guess the driver
must have cut off the road,

120
00:26:58,076 --> 00:27:00,120
into that gas station
by Beekman's Diner.

121
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,540
It went right through the billboard,

122
00:27:03,623 --> 00:27:06,459
ripped over a gas pump
and never stopped moving.

123
00:27:06,543 --> 00:27:09,170
By now it was like a moving bonfire.

124
00:27:12,590 --> 00:27:15,593
Didn't know if the truck
was going to explode or what.

125
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,808
I can still hear the man screaming...

126
00:27:26,396 --> 00:27:29,399
these things just backing away from it.

127
00:27:32,485 --> 00:27:37,365
I looked back at the diner to see if there
was anyone there who could help me.

128
00:27:39,784 --> 00:27:41,786
That was when I noticed that...

129
00:27:42,704 --> 00:27:45,040
the entire place had been encircled.

130
00:27:46,916 --> 00:27:49,627
Wasn't a sign of life left, except...

131
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:55,759
By now, there were no more screams.

132
00:27:58,053 --> 00:27:59,471
I realized that...

133
00:28:01,222 --> 00:28:02,640
I was alone,

134
00:28:02,724 --> 00:28:05,477
with 50 or 60 of those things

135
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:10,565
just standing there, staring at me.

136
00:28:12,692 --> 00:28:14,986
I-I started to drive. I...

137
00:28:16,196 --> 00:28:18,323
just plowed right through them.

138
00:28:19,491 --> 00:28:21,701
They didn't move.
They didn't run or...

139
00:28:23,536 --> 00:28:25,705
Just stood there, staring at me.

140
00:28:28,458 --> 00:28:30,710
I just wanted to crush them.

141
00:28:32,962 --> 00:28:34,464
They...

142
00:28:36,257 --> 00:28:39,177
scattered through the air, like bugs.

143
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,474
We were riding in the cemetery...

144
00:28:45,183 --> 00:28:46,768
Johnny and me.

145
00:28:47,894 --> 00:28:49,229
Johnny.

146
00:28:53,691 --> 00:28:55,527
We -

147
00:28:55,610 --> 00:28:59,656
We came to put a wreath
on my father's grave,

148
00:29:01,783 --> 00:29:03,576
Johnny and m...

149
00:29:04,244 --> 00:29:05,745
And he said,

150
00:29:06,830 --> 00:29:09,874
"Can I have some candy, Barbra?"

151
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:15,004
And we didn't have any.

152
00:29:17,924 --> 00:29:19,551
And...

153
00:29:22,053 --> 00:29:24,556
Oh, it's hot in here.

154
00:29:25,598 --> 00:29:27,100
Hot.

155
00:29:32,397 --> 00:29:34,607
Uh, and he said,

156
00:29:34,691 --> 00:29:36,651
"Oh, it's late.

157
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:39,529
Why did we start so late?"

158
00:29:39,612 --> 00:29:40,947
And I said,

159
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:46,369
"Johnny, if you'd gotten up earlier,
we wouldn't be late."

160
00:29:47,620 --> 00:29:50,832
Johnny asked me if I were afraid.

161
00:29:50,915 --> 00:29:53,960
And I said, "I'm not afraid, Johnny."

162
00:29:55,837 --> 00:29:59,174
And then this man
started walking up the road.

163
00:30:00,925 --> 00:30:03,136
He came slowly,

164
00:30:03,219 --> 00:30:05,555
and Johnny kept teasing me and saying,

165
00:30:05,638 --> 00:30:08,099
"He's coming to get you, Barbra."

166
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:12,020
And I laughed at him and said,
"Johnny, stop it."

167
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:15,773
And then Johnny ran away.

168
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,233
And I...

169
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:21,696
I went up to this man,
and I was going to apologize.

170
00:30:22,322 --> 00:30:24,491
Why don't you just keep calm?

171
00:30:24,574 --> 00:30:26,409
And I looked up, and...

172
00:30:26,493 --> 00:30:28,077
and I said, "Good eve -"

173
00:30:29,454 --> 00:30:31,122
And he grabbed me.

174
00:30:32,081 --> 00:30:34,167
He grabbed me!

175
00:30:34,250 --> 00:30:36,586
And he ripped at me!

176
00:30:36,669 --> 00:30:39,547
He held me and he ripped at my clothes!

177
00:30:39,631 --> 00:30:42,175
I think you should just calm down.

178
00:30:42,258 --> 00:30:44,928
Oh, I screamed, "Johnny!

179
00:30:45,011 --> 00:30:46,638
Johnny, help me!

180
00:30:46,721 --> 00:30:48,848
Oh, help me!"

181
00:30:48,932 --> 00:30:50,850
And he wouldn't let me go.

182
00:30:50,934 --> 00:30:52,936
He ripped...

183
00:30:53,978 --> 00:30:59,067
And then Johnny came, and he ran,
and he... he fought this man.

184
00:30:59,150 --> 00:31:02,904
And I got so afraid, I ran.

185
00:31:02,987 --> 00:31:04,280
I ran.

186
00:31:05,073 --> 00:31:06,491
I ran.

187
00:31:08,868 --> 00:31:10,912
And Johnny didn't come.

188
00:31:12,288 --> 00:31:15,708
We've got -
We have to wait for Johnny.

189
00:31:21,339 --> 00:31:24,050
Maybe we'd better go out and get him.

190
00:31:25,677 --> 00:31:27,762
We have to go out and get Johnny.

191
00:31:27,845 --> 00:31:29,347
He's out there.

192
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,100
Please! Don't you hear me?

193
00:31:32,183 --> 00:31:34,352
We've got to go out and get him.

194
00:31:36,104 --> 00:31:37,313
Please!

195
00:31:37,397 --> 00:31:39,983
We have got to go get Johnny!

196
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,068
Please help me!

197
00:31:42,151 --> 00:31:43,861
Please!

198
00:31:43,945 --> 00:31:46,906
Don't you know what's going on out there?
This is no Sunday school picnic.

199
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,951
Don't you understand?
My brother is alone!

200
00:31:50,034 --> 00:31:52,287
- Your brother is dead.
- No!

201
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:54,455
My brother is <i>not</i> dead!

202
00:31:55,290 --> 00:31:58,293
No! Oh!

203
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:50,762
<i>Because of the obvious threat
to untold numbers of citizens,</i>

204
00:32:50,845 --> 00:32:53,598
<i>and because of the crisis
which is even now developing,</i>

205
00:32:53,681 --> 00:32:57,060
<i>this radio station will remain
on the air, day and night.</i>

206
00:32:57,143 --> 00:32:59,854
<i>This station and hundreds
of other radio and TV stations</i>

207
00:32:59,937 --> 00:33:01,481
<i>throughout this part of the country</i>

208
00:33:01,564 --> 00:33:04,525
<i>are pooling their resources
through an emergency network hookup</i>

209
00:33:04,609 --> 00:33:06,986
<i>to keep you informed
of all developments.</i>

210
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:09,906
<i>At this hour, we repeat,
these are the facts as we know them.</i>

211
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:12,450
<i>There is an epidemic of mass murder
being committed</i>

212
00:33:12,533 --> 00:33:15,453
<i>by a virtual army
of unidentified assassins.</i>

213
00:33:15,536 --> 00:33:19,707
<i>The murders are taking place in villages,
cities, rural homes, and suburbs</i>

214
00:33:19,791 --> 00:33:22,752
<i>with no apparent pattern
or reason for the slayings.</i>

215
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:26,464
<i>It seems to be a sudden,
general explosion of mass homicide.</i>

216
00:33:26,547 --> 00:33:29,092
<i>We have some descriptions
of the assassins.</i>

217
00:33:29,175 --> 00:33:31,886
<i>Eyewitnesses say
they are ordinary-looking people.</i>

218
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:34,472
<i>Some say they appear to be
in a kind of trance.</i>

219
00:33:34,555 --> 00:33:35,932
<i>Others describe them as being...</i>

220
00:33:45,983 --> 00:33:48,986
<i>So, at this point there is no
really authentic way for us to say</i>

221
00:33:49,070 --> 00:33:52,156
<i>who or what to look for
and guard yourself against -</i>

222
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,492
<i>misshapen monsters.</i>

223
00:33:54,575 --> 00:33:58,287
<i>Reaction of law enforcement officials is
one of complete bewilderment at this hour.</i>

224
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:00,957
<i>So far we have been
unable to determine</i>

225
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,210
<i>that any kind of
organized investigation is yet under way.</i>

226
00:34:04,293 --> 00:34:07,130
<i>Police, sheriffs' deputies
and emergency ambulances</i>

227
00:34:07,213 --> 00:34:09,632
<i>are literally deluged with calls for help.</i>

228
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,051
<i>The scene can best be described
as mayhem.</i>

229
00:34:12,135 --> 00:34:14,804
<i>Mayors of Pittsburgh,
Philadelphia, and Miami,</i>

230
00:34:14,887 --> 00:34:17,849
<i>along with the governors of several
Eastern and Midwestern states,</i>

231
00:34:17,932 --> 00:34:21,102
<i>have indicated the national guard
may be mobilized at any moment,</i>

232
00:34:21,185 --> 00:34:23,062
<i>but that has not happened as yet.</i>

233
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:27,108
<i>The only advice our reporters
have been able to get from official sources</i>

234
00:34:27,191 --> 00:34:31,446
<i>is for private citizens to stay in
their homes behind locked doors.</i>

235
00:34:31,529 --> 00:34:33,656
<i>Do not venture outside for any reason</i>

236
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:36,033
<i>until the nature of this crisis
has been determined</i>

237
00:34:36,117 --> 00:34:38,870
<i>and until we can advise
what course of action to take.</i>

238
00:34:38,953 --> 00:34:41,247
<i>Keep listening to radio and TV</i>

239
00:34:41,330 --> 00:34:45,251
<i>for any special instructions
as this crisis develops further.</i>

240
00:34:45,334 --> 00:34:47,754
<i>Thousands of office and factory workers</i>

241
00:34:47,837 --> 00:34:50,381
<i>are being urged
to stay at their places of employment,</i>

242
00:34:50,465 --> 00:34:52,967
<i>not to make any attempt
to get to their homes.</i>

243
00:34:53,050 --> 00:34:55,136
<i>However, in spite of
this urging and warning,</i>

244
00:34:55,219 --> 00:34:59,223
<i>streets and highways are packed with frantic
people trying to reach their families,</i>

245
00:34:59,307 --> 00:35:01,893
<i>or apparently to flee just anywhere.</i>

246
00:35:01,976 --> 00:35:06,397
<i>We repeat: The safest course of action
at this time is simply to stay where you -</i>

247
00:35:25,875 --> 00:35:27,794
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
we've just received word</i>

248
00:35:27,877 --> 00:35:30,505
<i>that the president
has called a meeting of his cabinet</i>

249
00:35:30,588 --> 00:35:32,548
<i>to deal with
the sudden epidemic of murder</i>

250
00:35:32,632 --> 00:35:35,051
<i>which has seized
the eastern third of this nation.</i>

251
00:35:35,134 --> 00:35:37,470
<i>The meeting is scheduled
to convene within the hour.</i>

252
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,472
<i>Members of the presidential cabinet</i>

253
00:35:39,555 --> 00:35:44,393
<i>will be joined by officials of the FBI
and the joint chiefs behind closed doors.</i>

254
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:46,979
<i>A White House spokesman,
in announcing this conference,</i>

255
00:35:47,063 --> 00:35:48,606
<i>says there will be
an official announcement</i>

256
00:35:48,689 --> 00:35:50,775
<i>as soon as possible
following that meeting.</i>

257
00:35:50,858 --> 00:35:53,694
<i>This is the latest dispatch
just received in our newsroom.</i>

258
00:35:53,778 --> 00:35:58,908
<i>Latest word also from national press
services in Washington, DC, now tells us</i>

259
00:35:58,991 --> 00:36:01,702
<i>that the emergency presidential conference
which we've just mentioned</i>

260
00:36:01,786 --> 00:36:03,704
<i>will include high-ranking scientists</i>

261
00:36:03,788 --> 00:36:06,749
<i>from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration.</i>

262
00:36:06,833 --> 00:36:08,793
<i>That's the extent of this latest -</i>

263
00:36:18,052 --> 00:36:21,305
<i>All radio and TV stations
across the eastern part of the country,</i>

264
00:36:21,389 --> 00:36:23,391
<i>including the one
to which you are listening,</i>

265
00:36:23,474 --> 00:36:25,810
<i>have joined their facilities
in an emergency network</i>

266
00:36:25,893 --> 00:36:28,020
<i>to bring you this news as it develops.</i>

267
00:36:28,104 --> 00:36:34,402
<i>We urge you to stay tuned to radio and TV
and to stay indoors at all costs.</i>

268
00:36:34,485 --> 00:36:37,363
<i>Late reports reaching this newsroom
tell of frightened people</i>

269
00:36:37,446 --> 00:36:40,408
<i>seeking refuge in churches, schools,
and government buildings,</i>

270
00:36:40,491 --> 00:36:43,286
<i>demanding shelter and protection
from the wholesale murder</i>

271
00:36:43,369 --> 00:36:45,329
<i>which apparently is engulfing
much of the nation.</i>

272
00:36:45,413 --> 00:36:49,834
<i>Law enforcement officials are at a loss
to explain or, even at this hour,</i>

273
00:36:49,917 --> 00:36:53,212
<i>even to theorize about the reasons
for this wave of murder.</i>

274
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,924
<i>So far, all they're able to give the public
is something similar to the response</i>

275
00:36:57,008 --> 00:37:00,136
<i>of Chief T.K. Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina,</i>

276
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,138
<i>who is quoted as saying, quote,</i>

277
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:05,016
<i>"Tell the people, for God's sake,
to get off the streets.</i>

278
00:37:05,099 --> 00:37:08,352
<i>Tell 'em to go home
and lock their doors and windows up tight.</i>

279
00:37:08,436 --> 00:37:12,023
<i>We don't know what kind of
murder-happy characters we have here."</i>

280
00:37:12,106 --> 00:37:15,735
<i>End quote. That's Chief Dunmore
of Camden, North Carolina.</i>

281
00:37:16,652 --> 00:37:20,907
<i>So far the only descriptions,
the only clues anyone has of the killers</i>

282
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:23,159
<i>come from frightened witnesses.</i>

283
00:37:23,242 --> 00:37:27,914
<i>These eyewitness accounts variously describe
the murderers as "ordinary looking people,"</i>

284
00:37:27,997 --> 00:37:31,584
<i>"misshapen monsters,"
"people who look like they're in a trance,"</i>

285
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:35,546
<i>and "things that look like people
but act like animals."</i>

286
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:37,673
<i>Some eyewitnesses tell of seeing victims</i>

287
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:40,927
<i>who look as though
they had been torn apart.</i>

288
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,305
<i>This whole ghastly story
began developing two days ago</i>

289
00:37:44,388 --> 00:37:46,557
<i>with the report of the slaying
of a family of seven</i>

290
00:37:46,641 --> 00:37:48,976
<i>in their rural home
near Gulfport, Louisiana.</i>

291
00:37:49,060 --> 00:37:52,480
<i>Since then, reports of some
senseless killings began snowballing</i>

292
00:37:52,563 --> 00:37:56,484
<i>in a reign of terror which has hopscotched
in an erratic and disconnected pattern</i>

293
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:59,570
<i>throughout much of the eastern
and midwestern United States.</i>

294
00:37:59,654 --> 00:38:03,699
<i>Efforts to keep track of the murder reports
by the placing of markers on a map</i>

295
00:38:03,783 --> 00:38:07,787
<i>seem to indicate a general spreading
from the extreme southeastern United States</i>

296
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,372
<i>to the north and west.</i>

297
00:38:09,455 --> 00:38:12,875
<i>Our newsmen have been on the telephone,
talking with officials in other cities,</i>

298
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:16,337
<i>and have determined
that none of this kind of mass murder</i>

299
00:38:16,420 --> 00:38:18,881
<i>has yet been reported
west of the Mississippi River,</i>

300
00:38:18,965 --> 00:38:23,344
<i>except in the extreme
southeastern portion of Texas.</i>

301
00:38:23,427 --> 00:38:26,639
<i>Similar killings have been reported
around the Houston and Galveston areas,</i>

302
00:38:26,722 --> 00:38:29,725
<i>- but nothing like the...</i>
- I found a gun and some bullets out there.

303
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:32,603
<i>- It was only late yesterday -</i>
- Oh, and these.

304
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:36,649
<i>That it soon became clear that we were
facing some kind of national emergency.</i>

305
00:38:36,732 --> 00:38:39,026
<i>When first reports began filtering in,</i>

306
00:38:39,110 --> 00:38:41,278
<i>newsmen and law enforcement agencies
were of the opinion -</i>

307
00:38:41,362 --> 00:38:43,781
This place is boarded up pretty solid now.

308
00:38:44,949 --> 00:38:47,785
We ought to be all right here for a while.

309
00:38:47,868 --> 00:38:51,706
We have the gun and the bullets,
food and the radio.

310
00:38:51,789 --> 00:38:54,709
<i>...began to suspect
an obscure kind of conspiracy.</i>

311
00:38:54,792 --> 00:38:57,712
Sooner or later,
someone's bound to come and get us out.

<i>...creatures from outer space.</i>

313

<i>So again, we join with law enforcement agencies
in urging you to seek shelter in a building.</i>

314
00:39:04,760 --> 00:39:06,679
<i>Lock the doors and windows securely.</i>

315
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:08,681
Hey, that's us.
We're doing all right.

316
00:39:08,764 --> 00:39:11,017
<i>Be cautious of any suspicious strangers,</i>

317
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,728

<i>and further details
of this continuing story.</i>

319
00:39:16,272 --> 00:39:19,191
Look, I don't know if you're hearing me -

320
00:39:19,275 --> 00:39:20,651
But I'm going upstairs now.

321
00:39:20,735 --> 00:39:22,987
<i>It's almost as though
some critical balance -</i>

322
00:39:23,070 --> 00:39:25,364
If anything should try to break in here,
I can hear it from up there.

323
00:39:25,448 --> 00:39:27,950
I'll be down to take care of it.

324
00:39:28,034 --> 00:39:29,535
<i>We repeat: This radio station -</i>

325

Everything is all right for now. I'll be back
to reinforce the windows and doors later.

326
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:36,500
But you'll be all right for now. Okay?

327
00:39:39,003 --> 00:39:40,713
Okay?

Don't shoot. We're from town.

357
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:55,014
How long you guys been down there?
I could've used some help up here.

358
00:41:55,097 --> 00:41:56,640
That's the cellar.
It's the safest place.

359
00:41:56,724 --> 00:41:59,393
You mean you didn't hear the racket
we were making up here?

360
00:41:59,476 --> 00:42:01,604
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

361
00:42:01,687 --> 00:42:04,857
- Could've been those things, for all we knew.
- That girl was screaming.

362
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:07,026
Surely you must know
what a girl screaming sounds like.

363
00:42:07,109 --> 00:42:08,360
Those things don't make any noise.

364
00:42:08,444 --> 00:42:10,654
Anybody would know
somebody's in need of help.

365
00:42:10,738 --> 00:42:13,365
Look, it's kind of hard to hear
what's going on from down there.

366
00:42:13,449 --> 00:42:15,367
We thought we could hear screams,

367
00:42:15,451 --> 00:42:18,370
but for all we knew that could have meant
those things were in the house after her.

368
00:42:18,454 --> 00:42:21,582
- And you wouldn't come up and help?
- Well, if there were more -

369
00:42:21,665 --> 00:42:23,709
The racket sounded like
the place was being ripped apart.

370
00:42:23,792 --> 00:42:25,753
How were we supposed to know
what was going on?

371
00:42:25,836 --> 00:42:29,590
Now, wait a minute. You just got finished
saying you couldn't hear from down there.

372
00:42:29,673 --> 00:42:32,009
Now you say it sounded like
this place was being ripped apart.

373
00:42:32,092 --> 00:42:34,220
It would be nice
if you'd get your story straight, man.

374
00:42:34,303 --> 00:42:36,972
All right, now you tell <i>me.</i>

375
00:42:37,056 --> 00:42:40,976
I'm not gonna take that kind of a chance
when we've got a safe place.

376
00:42:41,060 --> 00:42:44,313
We luck into a safe place, and you're
telling us we've gotta risk our lives

377
00:42:44,396 --> 00:42:46,815
just because somebody
might need help, huh?

378
00:42:46,899 --> 00:42:48,150
Yeah. Something like that.

379
00:42:48,234 --> 00:42:50,861
- All right, why don't we settle this -
- Look, mister!

380
00:42:50,945 --> 00:42:53,155
We came up, okay? We're here.

381
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:56,909
Now, I suggest we all go back downstairs before
any of those things find out we're in here.

382
00:42:56,992 --> 00:42:58,994
They can't get in here.

383
00:42:59,078 --> 00:43:01,705
- You got the whole place boarded up?
- Yeah, most of it.

384
00:43:01,789 --> 00:43:04,583
All but a few spots upstairs.
They won't be hard to fix.

385
00:43:04,667 --> 00:43:07,461
You're insane.
The cellar's the safest place.

386
00:43:07,544 --> 00:43:09,588
I'm telling you, they can't get in here.

387
00:43:09,672 --> 00:43:12,716
And I'm telling you,
those things turned over our car.

388
00:43:12,800 --> 00:43:14,510
We were damned lucky
to get away at all.

389
00:43:14,593 --> 00:43:18,931
Now you tell me those things
can't get through this lousy pile of wood?

390
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:21,308
His wife and kid's downstairs.

391
00:43:21,392 --> 00:43:22,893
The kid's hurt.

392
00:43:24,228 --> 00:43:26,730
Well, I still think we're
better off up here.

393
00:43:27,731 --> 00:43:29,984
We could strengthen everything up,
Mr. Cooper.

394
00:43:30,067 --> 00:43:32,236
With all of us working,
we could fix this place up in no time.

395
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:34,238
We have everything we need up here.

396
00:43:34,321 --> 00:43:36,949
We can take all that stuff
downstairs with us.

397
00:43:37,032 --> 00:43:38,742
Man, you're really crazy.
You know that?

398
00:43:38,826 --> 00:43:41,120
You got a million windows up here.
All these windows.

399
00:43:41,203 --> 00:43:43,998
You're gonna make them strong enough
to keep these things out, huh?

400
00:43:44,081 --> 00:43:46,041
I told you, those things
don't have any strength.

401
00:43:46,125 --> 00:43:48,627
I smashed three of them
and pushed another one out the door.

402
00:43:48,711 --> 00:43:52,131
Did you hear me when I told you
they turned over our car?

403
00:43:52,214 --> 00:43:55,301
- Oh, hell, any good five men can do that.
- That's my point.

404
00:43:55,384 --> 00:43:57,594
Only there's not going to be five,
or even 10.

405
00:43:57,678 --> 00:44:00,097
There's gonna be 20, 30,
maybe a hundred of those things.

406
00:44:00,180 --> 00:44:02,891
And as soon as they know we're here,
this place is gonna be crawling with them.

407
00:44:02,975 --> 00:44:06,395
Well, if there are that many,
they'll probably get us wherever we are.

408
00:44:06,478 --> 00:44:09,481
Look, the cellar.

409
00:44:09,565 --> 00:44:14,069
The cellar, there's only one door, right?
Just one door. That's all we have to protect.

410
00:44:14,153 --> 00:44:17,364
Tom and I fixed it
so it locks and boards from the inside.

411
00:44:17,448 --> 00:44:21,243
But up here, all these windows, why, we'd
never know where they were gonna hit us next.

412
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:23,287
You got a point, Mr. Cooper.

413
00:44:23,370 --> 00:44:25,748
But down in the cellar,
there's no place to run to.

414
00:44:25,831 --> 00:44:29,460
I mean, if they did get in, there'd be
no back exit. We'd be done for.

415
00:44:29,543 --> 00:44:30,919
Ah!

416
00:44:31,003 --> 00:44:32,921
We can get out of here
if we have to.

417
00:44:33,005 --> 00:44:35,883
And we got windows
to see what's going on outside.

418
00:44:35,966 --> 00:44:39,762
But down there, with no windows, if a rescue
party did come, we wouldn't even know it.

419
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:42,056
But the cellar is the strongest place.

420
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:43,766
The cellar is a death trap.

421
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:46,268
I don't know, Mr. Cooper.

422
00:44:46,352 --> 00:44:48,187
I think he's right.

423
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,064
You know how many's out there?

424
00:44:50,147 --> 00:44:52,066
I don't know.
I figure maybe six or seven.

425
00:44:52,149 --> 00:44:55,611
Look.
You two can do whatever you like.

426
00:44:55,694 --> 00:44:57,738
I'm going back down to the cellar

427
00:44:57,821 --> 00:45:00,991
and you better decide,
'cause I'm gonna board up that door,

428
00:45:01,075 --> 00:45:03,744
and I'm not gonna unlock it again,
no matter what happens.

429
00:45:03,827 --> 00:45:06,080
- Now, wait a minute, Mr. Cooper.
- No, I'm not gonna wait!

430
00:45:06,163 --> 00:45:08,290
I've made my decision.
Now you make yours.

431
00:45:08,374 --> 00:45:10,959
Now, wait a minute!
Let's think about this.

432
00:45:11,043 --> 00:45:13,837
We can make it to the cellar
if we have to.

433
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:17,049
And if we do decide to stay down there,
we'll need some things from up here.

434
00:45:17,132 --> 00:45:20,094
So let's at least consider this a while.

435
00:45:20,177 --> 00:45:21,970
<i>...at all costs.</i>

436
00:45:22,054 --> 00:45:23,972
<i>Late reports reaching this newsroom -</i>

437
00:45:24,056 --> 00:45:27,393
If you box yourself in the cellar and those
things get in the house, you've had it.

438
00:45:27,476 --> 00:45:29,520
At least up here
you have a fighting chance.

439
00:45:33,857 --> 00:45:36,527
Yeah, it looks like
about eight or 10 out there now.

440
00:45:36,610 --> 00:45:38,612
That's more than there were.

441
00:45:38,695 --> 00:45:40,781
There are a lot out back too.

442
00:45:40,864 --> 00:45:42,866
<i>So far, the best advice they're...</i>

443
00:46:22,197 --> 00:46:24,116
- Harry?
- It's all right.

444
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:26,452
- Harry, what's happening?
- It's - It's all right!

445
00:46:41,758 --> 00:46:43,177
Damn thing.

446
00:47:22,591 --> 00:47:24,843
We gotta fix these boards.

447
00:47:24,927 --> 00:47:26,553
You're crazy!

448
00:47:26,637 --> 00:47:28,972
Those things are gonna be
at every window and door in this place!

449
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:30,766
We've got to get down into the cellar.

450
00:47:30,849 --> 00:47:33,644
Go down in your damn cellar!
Get out of here!

451
00:47:35,771 --> 00:47:38,023
- I'm - I'm taking the girl with me.
- You leave her here.

452
00:47:38,106 --> 00:47:41,151
Keep your hands off her,
and everything else that's up here too.

453
00:47:41,235 --> 00:47:43,820
Because if I stay up here,
I'm fighting for everything up here,

454
00:47:43,904 --> 00:47:46,573
and the radio and the food
is part of what I'm fighting for.

455
00:47:46,657 --> 00:47:49,493
- Now, if you're going down in the cellar, get.
- The man's insane.

456
00:47:50,118 --> 00:47:51,662
He's insane.

457
00:47:51,745 --> 00:47:53,956
We've got to have food down there.
We've got a right.

458
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:56,250
- This your house?
- We've got a right.

459
00:47:56,333 --> 00:47:58,794
- You going down there with him?
- W-Well, I -

460
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,797
Yes or no? This is your last chance.
No beating around the bush.

461
00:48:03,048 --> 00:48:05,133
Listen, I got a kid down there.

462
00:48:05,217 --> 00:48:07,135
She can't possib -
I couldn't bring her up here.

463
00:48:07,219 --> 00:48:10,931
She can't possibly take all the racket from
those things smashing through the windows.

464
00:48:11,014 --> 00:48:12,808
Well, you're her father.

465
00:48:12,891 --> 00:48:15,519
If you're stupid enough to go die
in that trap, that's your business.

466
00:48:15,602 --> 00:48:18,689
However, I am not stupid enough
to follow you.

467
00:48:18,772 --> 00:48:22,025
It is tough for the kid
that her old man is so stupid.

468
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,611
Now, get the hell down in the cellar.

469
00:48:24,695 --> 00:48:27,531
You can be the boss down there.
I'm boss up here.

470
00:48:29,283 --> 00:48:30,826
You bastards!

471
00:48:33,328 --> 00:48:35,956
You know, I won't open this door again.
I mean it.

472
00:48:36,039 --> 00:48:38,875
- Mr. Cooper, with your help, we can -
- With my help!

473
00:48:38,959 --> 00:48:42,337
Let him go, man.
His mind is made up. Just let him go.

474
00:48:44,798 --> 00:48:46,216
Wait a minute.

475
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:49,553
Judy? Come on up here, honey.

476
00:48:57,102 --> 00:49:00,439
- You're gonna let them get her too, huh?
- It's all right, honey. Go ahead.

477
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:14,745
If we stick together, man,
we can fix it up real good.

478
00:49:14,828 --> 00:49:18,081
But there - there's lots of places
we can run to up here.

479
00:49:18,165 --> 00:49:19,791
Mr. Cooper?

480
00:49:19,875 --> 00:49:24,087
We'd all be a lot better off
if all three of us were working together.

481
00:49:25,255 --> 00:49:26,965
Hey.

482
00:49:27,049 --> 00:49:28,550
Hey, kid.

483
00:49:36,808 --> 00:49:38,852
He's wrong, you know.

484
00:49:38,935 --> 00:49:41,271
I'm not boxing myself in down there.

485
00:49:41,355 --> 00:49:44,941
<i>To repeat, this radio station
will remain on the air day and night.</i>

486
00:49:47,903 --> 00:49:51,907
Well, we're safe now.
It's boarded up tight.

487
00:49:51,990 --> 00:49:53,825
What about Tom and Judy?

488
00:49:53,909 --> 00:49:55,994
They wanna stay up there, let 'em.

489
00:49:59,873 --> 00:50:03,335
There are... two other people upstairs.

490
00:50:03,919 --> 00:50:06,880
- A man and a girl.
- We heard the screaming.

491
00:50:06,963 --> 00:50:08,632
Yeah, but I didn't know who they were,

492
00:50:08,715 --> 00:50:11,760
and I wasn't about to take
any unnecessary chances.

493
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,845
Of course not, Harry.

494
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:29,611
- Is she all right?
- I don't know what it is.

495
00:50:29,695 --> 00:50:32,322
She feels warm. Maybe it's shock.

496
00:50:33,323 --> 00:50:35,325
Where'd you get the bandage?

497
00:50:35,409 --> 00:50:38,704
Some laundry in a basket.
I tore a sheet.

498
00:50:46,086 --> 00:50:48,255
Let them stay upstairs.

499
00:50:49,423 --> 00:50:51,550
Let them.

500
00:50:51,633 --> 00:50:54,511
Too many ways those monsters
can get in up there.

501
00:50:55,804 --> 00:50:57,848
We'll see who's right.

502
00:50:57,931 --> 00:51:01,143
We'll see, when they come begging me
to let them in down here.

503
00:51:01,768 --> 00:51:03,937
- That's important, isn't it?
- What?

504
00:51:04,020 --> 00:51:07,524
- To be right. Everybody else to be wrong.
- What do you mean by that?

505
00:51:11,153 --> 00:51:13,655
Does anyone up there know
why we're being attacked?

506
00:51:15,449 --> 00:51:17,826
Whatever it is,
it isn't just happening here.

507
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:21,163
It's some kind of mass murder.
It's going on everywhere.

508
00:51:21,246 --> 00:51:23,248
- The radio said to stay inside -
- Radio?

509
00:51:24,207 --> 00:51:26,084
Radio, upstairs. I heard a news bulletin.

510
00:51:26,168 --> 00:51:28,879
There's a radio upstairs,
and you boarded us in down here?

511
00:51:28,962 --> 00:51:30,797
- I know what I'm doing.
- What did it say?

512
00:51:30,881 --> 00:51:33,216
Nothing! Nothing!
They don't know anything yet.

513
00:51:33,300 --> 00:51:36,094
The - There's mass murder everywhere,

514
00:51:36,178 --> 00:51:38,889
and people are supposed to look
for a safe place to hide.

515
00:51:38,972 --> 00:51:41,433
Take the boards off that door.

516
00:51:41,516 --> 00:51:43,560
We are staying down here, Helen.

517
00:51:43,643 --> 00:51:46,813
Harry, that radio is at least
some kind of communication.

518
00:51:46,897 --> 00:51:50,192
If the authorities know what's happening,
well, they'll send people for us,

519
00:51:50,275 --> 00:51:52,068
or they'll tell us what to do.

520
00:51:52,152 --> 00:51:56,072
How are we going to know what's going on
if we lock ourselves in this dungeon?

521
00:52:05,874 --> 00:52:08,168
We may not enjoy living together...

522
00:52:09,753 --> 00:52:12,839
but dying together
isn't going to solve anything.

523
00:52:12,923 --> 00:52:14,758
Those people aren't our enemies.

524
00:52:15,342 --> 00:52:17,093
Mr. Cooper!

525
00:52:18,428 --> 00:52:21,556
Mr. Cooper?
Ben found a television set upstairs.

526
00:52:24,184 --> 00:52:26,728
Let's go up. Tom?

527
00:52:26,812 --> 00:52:28,146
Yes.

528
00:52:28,230 --> 00:52:31,608
If Judy would come downstairs
for a few minutes,

529
00:52:31,691 --> 00:52:34,402
Harry and I could come upstairs.

530
00:52:34,486 --> 00:52:37,072
Okay. Yeah. Right away.

531
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:42,160
- Will you do it?
- Do I have to?

532
00:52:42,244 --> 00:52:46,081
Look, honey, nothing's gonna get done
with them down there and us up here.

533
00:52:46,832 --> 00:52:49,251
Do this, for me.

534
00:52:49,334 --> 00:52:50,836
Okay.

535
00:52:51,503 --> 00:52:53,213
Okay, open up.

536
00:53:14,985 --> 00:53:17,153
I'll take good care of her, Helen.

537
00:53:20,031 --> 00:53:21,867
She's all I have.

538
00:53:23,493 --> 00:53:25,829
Why don't you go upstairs now?

539
00:53:53,189 --> 00:53:55,275
Her brother was killed.

540
00:53:55,358 --> 00:53:57,819
Hey, give me a hand with this thing.

541
00:53:58,653 --> 00:54:01,489
I gotta go help Ben with the television.

542
00:54:43,949 --> 00:54:46,493
Don't be afraid of me.

543
00:54:46,576 --> 00:54:49,245
I'm Helen Cooper, Harry's wife.

544
00:54:57,754 --> 00:54:59,756
This place is ridiculous.

545
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,926
Look at this.
There's a million weak spots up here.

546
00:55:05,095 --> 00:55:07,097
Give me one of those.

547
00:55:11,101 --> 00:55:13,186
Her brother was killed.

548
00:55:20,360 --> 00:55:23,196
And they talk about these windows.

549
00:55:23,279 --> 00:55:25,240
I can't see a damned thing.

550
00:55:25,323 --> 00:55:27,826
There could be 15 million
of those things out there.

551
00:55:27,909 --> 00:55:29,995
That's how much good these windows are.

552
00:55:34,082 --> 00:55:36,960
Why don't you do something
to help somebody?

553
00:55:42,215 --> 00:55:44,718
Here, I have it.
Drag a couple of those chairs together.

554
00:55:44,801 --> 00:55:46,886
There's a socket over here.

555
00:55:51,474 --> 00:55:54,269
Now, you'd better watch this
and try to understand what's going on.

556
00:55:56,312 --> 00:55:58,148
I don't want anyone's life on my hands.

557
00:55:58,231 --> 00:55:59,733
Is there anything I can do to help?

558
00:55:59,816 --> 00:56:01,693
I don't want to hear
any more from you, mister.

559
00:56:01,776 --> 00:56:03,945
If you stay up here,
you take orders from me!

560
00:56:04,029 --> 00:56:05,780
And that includes leaving the girl alone.

561
00:56:05,864 --> 00:56:08,408
- It's on! It's on!
- There's no sound.

562
00:56:09,492 --> 00:56:11,369
Play with the rabbit ears.

563
00:56:11,453 --> 00:56:14,414
<i>Reports, incredible as they seem,</i>

564
00:56:14,497 --> 00:56:17,000
<i>are not the results of mass hysteria.</i>

565
00:56:17,083 --> 00:56:18,209
Mass hysteria.

566
00:56:18,293 --> 00:56:20,170
What do they think,
we're imagining all this?

567
00:56:20,253 --> 00:56:21,296
Shut up.

568
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,131
<i>In all parts of the country.</i>

569
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:26,134
<i>The wave of murder which is sweeping
the eastern third of the nation</i>

570
00:56:26,217 --> 00:56:31,097
<i>is being committed by creatures
who feast upon the flesh of their victims.</i>

571
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:34,434
<i>First eyewitness accounts
of this grisly development</i>

572
00:56:34,517 --> 00:56:39,147
<i>came from people who were understandably
frightened and almost incoherent.</i>

573
00:56:39,230 --> 00:56:43,735
<i>Officials and newsmen at first discounted
those eyewitness descriptions</i>

574
00:56:43,818 --> 00:56:45,653
<i>as being beyond belief.</i>

575
00:56:45,737 --> 00:56:47,947
<i>However, the reports persisted.</i>

576
00:56:48,031 --> 00:56:50,658
<i>Medical examinations
of some of the victims</i>

577
00:56:50,742 --> 00:56:53,953
<i>bore out the fact
that they had been partially devoured.</i>

578
00:56:56,206 --> 00:56:59,167
<i>I think we have some late word
just arriving,</i>

579
00:56:59,250 --> 00:57:01,294
<i>and we interrupt to bring this to you.</i>

580
00:57:02,629 --> 00:57:04,631
<i>This is the latest disclosure in a report</i>

581
00:57:04,714 --> 00:57:07,425
<i>from National Civil Defense headquarters
in Washington.</i>

582
00:57:08,510 --> 00:57:11,971
<i>It has been established
that persons who have recently died</i>

583
00:57:12,055 --> 00:57:15,683
<i>have been returning to life
and committing acts of murder.</i>

584
00:57:16,768 --> 00:57:19,729
<i>A widespread investigation
of reports from funeral homes,</i>

585
00:57:19,813 --> 00:57:21,481
<i>morgues, and hospitals</i>

586
00:57:21,564 --> 00:57:25,527
<i>has concluded that the unburied dead
are coming back to life</i>

587
00:57:25,610 --> 00:57:27,987
<i>and seeking human victims.</i>

588
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:31,407
<i>It's hard for us here to believe
what we're reporting to you,</i>

589
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,493
<i>but it does seem to be a fact.</i>

590
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:36,371
<i>When this emergency first began,</i>

591
00:57:36,454 --> 00:57:39,791
<i>radio and television
was advising people to stay inside,</i>

592
00:57:39,874 --> 00:57:42,043
<i>behind locked doors, for safety.</i>

593
00:57:42,127 --> 00:57:44,420
<i>Well, that situation has now changed.</i>

594
00:57:44,504 --> 00:57:47,841
<i>We're able to report
a definite course of action for you.</i>

595
00:57:47,924 --> 00:57:50,385
<i>Civil defense machinery has been organized</i>

596
00:57:50,468 --> 00:57:54,389
<i>to provide rescue stations
with food, shelter, medical treatment,</i>

597
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:57,058
<i>and protection
by armed national guardsmen.</i>

598
00:57:57,142 --> 00:58:00,603
<i>Stay tuned to the broadcasting stations
in your local area</i>

599
00:58:00,687 --> 00:58:02,689
<i>for this list of rescue stations.</i>

600
00:58:02,772 --> 00:58:05,775
<i>This list will be repeated
throughout our news coverage.</i>

601
00:58:05,859 --> 00:58:08,987
<i>Look for the name
of the rescue station nearest you</i>

602
00:58:09,070 --> 00:58:12,532
<i>and make your way to that location
as soon as possible.</i>

603
00:58:12,615 --> 00:58:15,368
So we have that truck. If we can get
some gas, we can get outta here.

604
00:58:15,451 --> 00:58:18,246
- There's a pump out by the shed.
- I know. That's why I pulled in here.

605
00:58:18,329 --> 00:58:19,873
But it's locked.

606
00:58:19,956 --> 00:58:22,167
<i>...emergency meeting called
this afternoon by the president.</i>

607
00:58:22,250 --> 00:58:25,211
<i>Since convening, this conference
of the presidential cabinet,</i>

608
00:58:25,295 --> 00:58:28,798
<i>the FBI, the joint chiefs of staff, the CIA</i>

609
00:58:28,882 --> 00:58:31,259
<i>has not produced any public information.</i>

610
00:58:31,342 --> 00:58:36,055
<i>Why are space experts being consulted
about an earthbound emergency?</i>

611
00:58:36,931 --> 00:58:39,893
<i>So far, all the betting
on the answer to that question</i>

612
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:42,854
<i>centers on the recent explorer satellite
shot to Venus.</i>

613
00:58:44,147 --> 00:58:48,943
<i>That satellite, you recall,
started back to Earth, but never got here.</i>

614
00:58:49,027 --> 00:58:50,987
<i>That's the space vehicle
which orbited Venus</i>

615
00:58:51,070 --> 00:58:53,865
<i>and then was purposely destroyed by NASA</i>

616
00:58:53,948 --> 00:58:55,867
<i>when scientists discovered it was carrying</i>

617
00:58:55,950 --> 00:58:58,786
<i>a mysterious, high-level radiation with it.</i>

618
00:58:58,870 --> 00:59:01,539
<i>Could that radiation
be somehow responsible</i>

619
00:59:01,623 --> 00:59:04,459
<i>for the wholesale murders
we're now suffering?</i>

620
00:59:04,542 --> 00:59:07,879
<i>Newsman Don Quinn in Washington
has posed those questions.</i>

621
00:59:07,962 --> 00:59:10,632
It's obvious.
Our best move is to try to get out of here.

622
00:59:10,715 --> 00:59:13,259
- How are you gonna get over to that pump?
- Look!

623
00:59:14,510 --> 00:59:17,013
<i>You're coming from a meeting regarding
the explosion of the Venus probe.</i>

624
00:59:17,096 --> 00:59:18,598
<i>Is that right?</i>

625
00:59:18,681 --> 00:59:20,558
<i>Yes, yes,
that was the subject of the meeting.</i>

626
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:23,353
<i>Do you feel there is a connection
between this and the phenomenon -</i>

627
00:59:23,436 --> 00:59:26,022
<i>There's a definite connection.
A definite connection.</i>

628
00:59:26,105 --> 00:59:28,399
<i>In other words, you feel that
the radiation on the Venus probe</i>

629
00:59:28,483 --> 00:59:30,068
<i>is enough to cause these mutations?</i>

630
00:59:30,151 --> 00:59:32,820
<i>- There was a very high degree of radiation.
- Well, just a minute.</i>

631
00:59:32,904 --> 00:59:35,698
<i>I'm not sure that that's certain at all.
I don't think that has been -</i>

632
00:59:35,782 --> 00:59:38,576
<i>It's the only logical explanation
that we have at this time.</i>

633
00:59:38,660 --> 00:59:40,787
<i>In other words,
it is the military's viewpoint that this -</i>

634
00:59:40,870 --> 00:59:42,997
<i>the radiation
is not the cause of the mutation.</i>

635
00:59:43,081 --> 00:59:46,459
<i>I can't speak for the entire military
at this time, gentlemen.</i>

636
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,795
<i>I must disagree
with these gentlemen presently,</i>

637
00:59:48,878 --> 00:59:51,798
<i>until we -
until this is irrefutably proved.</i>

638
00:59:51,881 --> 00:59:54,050
<i>Everything is being done that can be done.</i>

639
00:59:54,133 --> 00:59:56,427
<i>We'll have to hurry for our next meeting.</i>

640
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,973
<i>Professor, you feel that there is
a definite connection between -</i>

641
01:00:00,056 --> 01:00:02,892
<i>A definite connection
as far as Dr. Keller and myself-</i>

642
01:00:02,976 --> 01:00:06,521
<i>Doctor, please. I thought
we decided that is not proved yet.</i>

643
01:00:06,604 --> 01:00:09,482
<i>Was it - Was the satellite -
When the satellite was exploded -</i>

644
01:00:09,565 --> 01:00:11,567
<i>It was an unusual amount of radiation,</i>

645
01:00:11,651 --> 01:00:14,362
<i>enough to cause mutation
under certain circumstances.</i>

646
01:00:14,445 --> 01:00:16,781
<i>Could have happened
to have a bearing on it.</i>

647
01:00:16,864 --> 01:00:19,075
<i>It does seem to have a bearing on it.</i>

648
01:00:19,158 --> 01:00:21,911
<i>- Will there be a reply for the -
- Later.</i>

649
01:00:21,995 --> 01:00:23,413
<i>- Yes.
- There will be a reply?</i>

650
01:00:23,496 --> 01:00:25,498
<i>- Yes.
- Later this afternoon?</i>

651
01:00:27,417 --> 01:00:29,335
<i>There will be a report this afternoon?</i>

652
01:00:29,419 --> 01:00:31,671
<i>- Perhaps there will be a report later.
- Yes. Yes.</i>

653
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:33,256
<i>Will you close the window?</i>

654
01:00:33,339 --> 01:00:36,134
<i>We are doing everything possible
to solve the problem.</i>

655
01:00:38,636 --> 01:00:42,307
<i>We're hoping to get
some further explanation of this -</i>

656
01:00:42,390 --> 01:00:44,767
We've heard all we need to know.
We have to try to get out of here.

657
01:00:44,851 --> 01:00:47,812
He said the rescue stations
have doctors and medical supplies.

658
01:00:47,895 --> 01:00:50,315
If we could get Karen there,
we can get help for her.

659
01:00:50,398 --> 01:00:52,608
<i>...is one of the world's
foremost authorities</i>

660
01:00:52,692 --> 01:00:54,694
<i>on space science and technology.</i>

661
01:00:54,777 --> 01:00:56,988
Willard. I saw a
sign that said Willard.

662
01:00:57,071 --> 01:00:59,365
It's only about 17 miles from here.

663
01:00:59,449 --> 01:01:01,409
You know this area.
Are you from around here?

664
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:03,453
Judy and I are both from around here.

665
01:01:03,536 --> 01:01:05,705
We were on our way up to the lake
to go swimming.

666
01:01:05,788 --> 01:01:08,833
And Judy had a radio,
and we heard the first reports about this.

667
01:01:08,916 --> 01:01:10,960
So we knew the old house was here
and we came in

668
01:01:11,044 --> 01:01:13,254
and found the lady upstairs, dead.

669
01:01:13,338 --> 01:01:14,964
Then these other people came.

670
01:01:15,048 --> 01:01:17,342
We went down into the basement
and put a bar across the door,

671
01:01:17,425 --> 01:01:18,926
and it is pretty strong.

672
01:01:19,010 --> 01:01:21,387
How could we possibly get away from here?

673
01:01:21,471 --> 01:01:23,973
We've got a sick child, two women,

674
01:01:24,057 --> 01:01:25,683
one woman out of her head,

675
01:01:25,767 --> 01:01:28,811
three men, and the place
is surrounded with these things.

676
01:01:29,979 --> 01:01:32,815
<i>Dr. Grimes, your entire staff, I know,</i>

677
01:01:32,899 --> 01:01:34,650
<i>has been working very hard</i>

678
01:01:34,734 --> 01:01:38,154
<i>to find some solution
to these things that are happening.</i>

679
01:01:38,237 --> 01:01:40,239
<i>Do you have any answers at this time?</i>

680
01:01:40,323 --> 01:01:42,158
<i>Yes, we have some answers.</i>

681
01:01:42,241 --> 01:01:45,912
<i>But first let me stress the importance
of seeking medical attention</i>

682
01:01:45,995 --> 01:01:48,081
<i>for anyone who's been injured in any way.</i>

683
01:01:48,164 --> 01:01:52,418
<i>We don't know yet what complications
might result from such injuries.</i>

684
01:01:52,502 --> 01:01:53,961
How bad has your kid been hurt?

685
01:01:56,381 --> 01:01:58,633
Um...

686
01:01:58,716 --> 01:02:01,886
Look, you go down there and tell - Judy?

687
01:02:01,969 --> 01:02:05,431
Yeah, you tell Judy to come up here,
and you stay with the kid, all right?

688
01:02:05,515 --> 01:02:08,976
<i>Destructive action taken
with regard to the Venus probe.</i>

689
01:02:09,060 --> 01:02:11,479
<i>In the cold room at the university,</i>

690
01:02:11,562 --> 01:02:13,064
<i>we had a cadaver.</i>

691
01:02:13,147 --> 01:02:17,443
<i>A cadaver from which all four limbs
had been amputated.</i>

692
01:02:17,527 --> 01:02:19,487
<i>Sometime early this morning,</i>

693
01:02:19,570 --> 01:02:22,740
<i>it opened its eyes and
began to move its trunk.</i>

694
01:02:22,824 --> 01:02:26,035
<i>It was dead,
but it opened its eyes and tried to move.</i>

695
01:02:28,704 --> 01:02:31,833
They want you upstairs.
Did she ask for me?

696
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,377
She hasn't said anything.

697
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:36,462
I don't understand.

698
01:02:37,255 --> 01:02:40,216
Baby? It's Mommy.

699
01:02:41,426 --> 01:02:42,718
I hurt.

700
01:02:44,011 --> 01:02:47,515
I'll come back down
as soon as I find out what they want.

701
01:02:47,598 --> 01:02:49,434
Thank you, Judy.

702
01:02:50,184 --> 01:02:52,103
<i>The bodies should be disposed of at once,</i>

703
01:02:52,186 --> 01:02:53,980
<i>preferably by cremation.</i>

704
01:02:54,063 --> 01:02:55,690
<i>Well, how long after death, then,</i>

705
01:02:55,773 --> 01:02:57,650
<i>does the body become reactivated?</i>

706
01:02:57,733 --> 01:02:59,402
<i>It's only a matter of minutes.</i>

707
01:02:59,485 --> 01:03:02,196
<i>Minutes? Well, that doesn't give people
time to make any arrangements.</i>

708
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:05,741
<i>No, you're right. It doesn't give them
time to make funeral arrangements.</i>

709
01:03:05,825 --> 01:03:10,204
<i>The bodies must be carried
to the street and - and burned.</i>

710
01:03:10,288 --> 01:03:11,956
<i>They must be burned immediately.</i>

711
01:03:12,039 --> 01:03:14,500
<i>Soak them with gasoline and burn them.</i>

712
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:17,962
<i>The bereaved will have to forgo
the dubious comforts</i>

713
01:03:18,045 --> 01:03:20,506
<i>that a funeral service will give.</i>

714
01:03:20,590 --> 01:03:23,843
<i>They're just dead flesh, and dangerous.</i>

715
01:03:23,926 --> 01:03:28,973
Judy, I need you to find some bedspreads or
sheets to tear up into small strips, okay?

716
01:03:29,056 --> 01:03:31,058
- Is there a fruit cellar here?
- Yes.

717
01:03:31,142 --> 01:03:33,644
We need some bottles or jars
to make Molotov cocktails

718
01:03:33,728 --> 01:03:35,354
to hold them off while we try to escape.

719
01:03:35,438 --> 01:03:37,482
Hey, there's a big can
of kerosene down there.

720
01:03:37,565 --> 01:03:40,276
- I'll see what I can find.
- I'll look for the bottles.

721
01:03:40,359 --> 01:03:42,153
There's a big key ring down there.

722
01:03:42,236 --> 01:03:44,322
There may be a key to the gas pump on it.

723
01:03:44,405 --> 01:03:45,990
I'll check.

724
01:03:46,073 --> 01:03:48,868
We can toss the cocktails
from a window upstairs.

725
01:03:48,951 --> 01:03:51,245
Meantime, a couple of us
can go out and try to get the gas,

726
01:03:51,329 --> 01:03:52,914
then come back for the rest of the people.

727
01:03:52,997 --> 01:03:54,790
But that'll leave a door open someplace.

728
01:03:54,874 --> 01:03:57,919
Yeah, that's right. It better be this door.

729
01:03:58,002 --> 01:04:00,129
It's closer to the truck.

730
01:04:00,213 --> 01:04:02,798
Before we go out, we'll put
some supplies behind the cellar door.

731
01:04:02,882 --> 01:04:04,967
While we're gone,
the rest of you can hole up in there.

732
01:04:05,051 --> 01:04:07,136
I found some fruit jars in the cellar.

733
01:04:07,220 --> 01:04:09,972
And there's a key on here
that's labeled for the gas pump out back.

734
01:04:11,516 --> 01:04:14,519
I'm not really that used to the truck.
I found it abandoned.

735
01:04:15,520 --> 01:04:17,855
I can handle the truck, no sweat.

736
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:23,402
You're it then. You and I will go.

737
01:04:28,407 --> 01:04:32,119
We'll put whatever lumber we find
behind the cellar door.

738
01:04:32,203 --> 01:04:35,665
You can go upstairs
and toss the cocktails from a window.

739
01:04:35,748 --> 01:04:38,000
Tom, you and I will have
to unboard this door.

740
01:04:38,084 --> 01:04:40,962
After you toss the cocktails, you hustle
back down here and lock this door.

741
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:45,007
It's no good to board it up
because we'll have to get back in quickly.

742
01:04:45,716 --> 01:04:48,719
After we get the gas
and get back into the house,

743
01:04:48,803 --> 01:04:51,180
then we'll worry
about getting everybody into the truck.

744
01:04:51,264 --> 01:04:52,765
Now, let's move it.

745
01:04:53,808 --> 01:04:55,685
<i>No place to flee for safety,</i>

746
01:04:55,768 --> 01:04:58,312
<i>except for the rescue stations
which have been set up.</i>

747
01:04:58,396 --> 01:05:01,732
<i>Indications are
that before this emergency is over,</i>

748
01:05:01,816 --> 01:05:05,736
<i>we will need many, many more
such rescue stations.</i>

749
01:05:14,245 --> 01:05:16,497
You always have a smile for me.

750
01:05:16,581 --> 01:05:19,250
How can you smile like that all the time?

751
01:05:20,876 --> 01:05:22,878
How many do you have done?

752
01:05:26,007 --> 01:05:27,800
Come on, honey. We gotta move.

753
01:05:28,634 --> 01:05:32,054
- Tom, are you sure about the phone?
- The phone is dead out.

754
01:05:32,138 --> 01:05:34,223
All you get is a recorded message.

755
01:05:35,308 --> 01:05:38,686
If I could only call the folks.
They're going to be so worried about us.

756
01:05:40,146 --> 01:05:41,897
Everything'll be all right.

757
01:05:41,981 --> 01:05:44,900
As soon as we get to Willard, we'll
call them. They might even be there.

758
01:05:46,193 --> 01:05:47,695
I know.

759
01:05:51,282 --> 01:05:52,783
- Tom?
- Hmm.

760
01:05:54,702 --> 01:05:56,787
Are you sure we're doing
the right thing, Tom?

761
01:05:56,871 --> 01:05:59,040
- What, about getting outta here?
- Yeah.

762
01:05:59,123 --> 01:06:01,834
Well, the television said
that's the right thing to do.

763
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:03,669
We've got to get to a rescue station.

764
01:06:04,462 --> 01:06:06,297
- I don't know.
- Come on, honey.

765
01:06:06,380 --> 01:06:08,132
You're starting to sound
like Mr. Cooper now.

766
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:10,092
But why do you have to go out there?

767
01:06:10,176 --> 01:06:14,055
Look, I know how to handle that truck.
And I can handle the pump.

768
01:06:14,138 --> 01:06:16,098
Ben doesn't know
anything about that stuff.

769
01:06:17,975 --> 01:06:20,561
- But we're safe in here.
- For how long, honey?

770
01:06:20,645 --> 01:06:22,772
We're safe now.

771
01:06:22,855 --> 01:06:24,940
But there's gonna be more and more
of those things.

772
01:06:25,024 --> 01:06:27,026
I know. I know all that.

773
01:06:31,072 --> 01:06:33,407
Hey. Listen.

774
01:06:33,491 --> 01:06:36,035
Remember when we had the big flood?

775
01:06:36,118 --> 01:06:39,830
Remember how difficult it was for us
to convince you that it was right to leave?

776
01:06:40,748 --> 01:06:43,376
Remember?
Remember we had to go to Willard then?

777
01:06:43,459 --> 01:06:45,836
This isn't a passing thing, honey.

778
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:49,632
It - It's not like
just a wind passing through.

779
01:06:49,715 --> 01:06:52,301
We've got to do something, and fast.

780
01:06:58,349 --> 01:07:01,018
I just don't want you to go out there,
that's all.

781
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:02,770
Hey.

782
01:07:02,853 --> 01:07:05,022
Smile, honey.

783
01:07:05,106 --> 01:07:07,108
Where's that big smile for me?

784
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:11,362
Boy.

785
01:07:11,445 --> 01:07:14,031
You sure are no use at all, are you?

786
01:07:14,115 --> 01:07:16,659
We've got work to do, honey.

787
01:07:16,742 --> 01:07:18,369
And you - you -

788
01:07:35,094 --> 01:07:36,887
We better get her downstairs.

789
01:07:36,971 --> 01:07:39,598
We have to go downstairs now, Barbra.

790
01:07:41,350 --> 01:07:43,519
She's right.
You have to go downstairs now.

791
01:07:43,602 --> 01:07:46,731
Just for a little while, until we get back.

792
01:07:46,814 --> 01:07:48,733
Then we can all leave.

793
01:07:48,816 --> 01:07:51,235
Oh, I'd like to leave. Yes.

794
01:08:10,546 --> 01:08:12,757
- Good luck.
- Yeah.

795
01:09:02,473 --> 01:09:04,016
- You ready upstairs?
- Yeah.

796
01:09:04,099 --> 01:09:05,893
Okay, toss 'em!

797
01:09:46,100 --> 01:09:47,434
Go ahead! Go on!

798
01:10:03,659 --> 01:10:05,953
- I'm going with him.
- Get back in the cellar!

799
01:10:06,036 --> 01:10:08,247
- No!
- It's too late. Too late!

800
01:10:16,297 --> 01:10:18,591
Well, is she coming? Come on.

801
01:10:19,925 --> 01:10:21,427
Get in!

802
01:11:33,707 --> 01:11:35,918
- Come on!
- This key won't work.

803
01:11:36,001 --> 01:11:37,211
Watch it.

804
01:11:43,092 --> 01:11:44,218
Watch the torch!

805
01:11:51,266 --> 01:11:53,018
We've gotta get away from the pump!

806
01:12:04,571 --> 01:12:05,906
Hang on!

807
01:12:06,991 --> 01:12:09,660
Tom! Tom, you guys need
to get out of the truck!

808
01:12:28,262 --> 01:12:30,597
Come on. Let's get outta here.

809
01:12:31,432 --> 01:12:34,852
- Come on, come on!
- My jacket's caught.

810
01:13:41,627 --> 01:13:44,046
Let me in! Let me in!

811
01:13:45,255 --> 01:13:46,340
Cooper!

812
01:13:46,423 --> 01:13:47,508
Cooper!

813
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:53,824
I ought to drag you out there
and feed you to those things!

814
01:16:23,872 --> 01:16:26,041
Isn't it three o'clock yet?

815
01:16:30,545 --> 01:16:33,548
There's supposed to be another broadcast
at three o'clock.

816
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:35,884
Ten minutes.

817
01:16:35,968 --> 01:16:39,721
Oh. Only 10 more minutes?

818
01:16:39,805 --> 01:16:42,683
We don't have very long to wait.

819
01:16:42,766 --> 01:16:44,559
We can leave.

820
01:16:45,644 --> 01:16:48,272
Well, we'd better leave soon.

821
01:16:48,355 --> 01:16:50,440
It's 10 minutes to 3:00.

822
01:16:55,904 --> 01:16:59,825
You know anything about this area at all?
I mean, is Willard the nearest town?

823
01:17:02,327 --> 01:17:04,162
I don't know.

824
01:17:06,248 --> 01:17:07,749
We were...

825
01:17:10,127 --> 01:17:13,338
just trying to get to a motel before dark.

826
01:17:14,548 --> 01:17:16,550
You said those things
turned your car over.

827
01:17:16,633 --> 01:17:19,428
You think we can get it back
on its wheels and drive it? Where is it?

828
01:17:19,511 --> 01:17:22,472
Seems like it was pretty far away.

829
01:17:22,556 --> 01:17:24,349
Seems like we ran.

830
01:17:25,350 --> 01:17:27,185
Forget it. It's at least a mile.

831
01:17:27,936 --> 01:17:29,604
Johnny has the keys.

832
01:17:30,230 --> 01:17:33,775
You're going to carry that child a mile?
Through that army of things out there?

833
01:17:33,859 --> 01:17:37,362
I can carry the kid.
What's wrong with her? How'd she get hurt?

834
01:17:39,031 --> 01:17:41,992
- One of those things grabbed her.
- Bit her on the arm.

835
01:17:43,994 --> 01:17:45,162
What's wrong?

836
01:17:45,245 --> 01:17:48,957
Who knows what kind of disease
those things carry?

837
01:17:49,041 --> 01:17:51,626
- Is she conscious?
- Barely.

838
01:17:52,294 --> 01:17:53,920
She can't walk. She's too weak.

839
01:17:57,591 --> 01:18:01,678
- Well, one of us could try to get to the car.
- You gonna turn it over by yourself?

840
01:18:01,762 --> 01:18:05,015
You can't start the car.
Johnny has the keys.

841
01:18:08,435 --> 01:18:11,563
You have a car? Where? Where is it?

842
01:18:11,646 --> 01:18:14,024
- You won't be able to start it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

843
01:18:14,107 --> 01:18:16,193
But where is it?

844
01:18:28,413 --> 01:18:29,915
Good Lord.

845
01:18:40,133 --> 01:18:41,885
<i>...being monitored closely by scientists</i>

846
01:18:41,968 --> 01:18:44,971

01:18:45,055 --> 01:18:48,892
<i>At this hour, they report the level

849
01:18:51,561 --> 01:18:53,688
<i>So long as this situation remains,</i>

850
01:18:53,772 --> 01:18:56,733

that dead bodies will continue</i>

851
01:18:56,817 --> 01:18:59,403
<i>to be transformed

<i>Our news cameras have just returned</i>

856
01:19:13,125 --> 01:19:16,503
<i>from covering such a search-and-destroy
operation against the ghouls,</i>

857

<i>in Butler County, Pennsylvania.</i>

859
01:19:21,174 --> 01:19:23,635
<i>So now let's go to that filmed report.</i>

860
01:19:23,718 --> 01:19:26,430
<i>All law enforcement agencies
and the military</i>

861
01:19:26,513 --> 01:19:30,600
<i>have been organized to search out
and destroy the marauding ghouls.</i>

862
01:19:30,684 --> 01:19:33,770
<i>The survival command center
at the Pentagon has disclosed</i>

863
01:19:33,854 --> 01:19:38,024
<i>that a ghoul can be killed
by a shot in the head</i>

864
01:19:38,108 --> 01:19:40,694
<i>or a heavy blow to the skull.</i>

865
01:19:40,777 --> 01:19:42,654
<i>Officials are quoted as explaining</i>

866
01:19:42,737 --> 01:19:46,533
<i>that since the brain of a ghoul
has been activated by the radiation,</i>

867
01:19:46,616 --> 01:19:50,954
<i>the plan is,
kill the brain and you kill the ghoul.</i>

868
01:19:52,038 --> 01:19:55,333
<i>- Want anything from the supply wagon, Kus?
- Uh, no, we're all right.</i>

869
01:19:55,417 --> 01:19:56,793
<i>Okay.</i>

870
01:19:56,877 --> 01:19:59,171
<i>Hey, Cass,
put that thing all the way in the fire.</i>

871
01:19:59,254 --> 01:20:01,631
<i>- We don't want it getting up again.
- All right. I gotcha.</i>

872
01:20:01,715 --> 01:20:03,842
<i>Chief McClelland, how is everything going?</i>

873
01:20:03,925 --> 01:20:07,345
<i>Ah, things aren't going too bad.
Men are taking it pretty good.</i>

874
01:20:07,429 --> 01:20:10,015
<i>You want to get on the other side
of the road over there.</i>

875
01:20:10,098 --> 01:20:12,517
<i>Chief, do you think we'll be able
to defeat these things?</i>

876
01:20:12,601 --> 01:20:15,187
<i>Well, we killed 19 of them today,
right in this area.</i>

877
01:20:15,270 --> 01:20:18,523
<i>Those last three we caught trying to
claw their way into an abandoned shed.</i>

878
01:20:18,607 --> 01:20:20,609
<i>They must have thought
somebody was in there.</i>

879
01:20:20,692 --> 01:20:23,069
<i>There wasn't though.
We heard 'em making all kind of noise.</i>

880
01:20:23,153 --> 01:20:25,614
<i>We came over and beat 'em off,
blasted 'em down.</i>

881
01:20:25,697 --> 01:20:27,866
<i>Chief, as soon as you're finished,
can I see you here?</i>

882
01:20:27,949 --> 01:20:29,159
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

883
01:20:29,242 --> 01:20:31,745
<i>Chief, if I were surrounded
by six or eight of these things,</i>

884
01:20:31,828 --> 01:20:33,455
<i>would I stand a chance with them?</i>

885
01:20:33,538 --> 01:20:35,832
<i>Well, there's no problem.
If you had a gun, shoot 'em in the head.</i>

886
01:20:35,916 --> 01:20:37,417
<i>That's a sure way to kill 'em.</i>

887
01:20:37,501 --> 01:20:40,128
<i>If you don't, get yourself a club
or a torch. Beat 'em or burn 'em.</i>

888
01:20:40,212 --> 01:20:41,713
<i>They go up pretty easy.</i>

889
01:20:41,796 --> 01:20:44,299
<i>Well, Chief McClelland,
how long do you think it will take you</i>

890
01:20:44,382 --> 01:20:46,384
<i>until you get the situation under control?</i>

891
01:20:46,468 --> 01:20:49,262
<i>Well, that's pretty hard to say.
We don't know how many of 'em there are.</i>

892
01:20:49,346 --> 01:20:51,973
<i>We know when we find 'em, we can kill 'em.</i>

893
01:20:52,057 --> 01:20:54,976
<i>- Are they slow-moving, Chief?
- Yeah, they're dead.</i>

894
01:20:55,060 --> 01:20:56,895
<i>They're all messed up.</i>

895
01:20:56,978 --> 01:21:01,316
<i>Well, in time, would you say you oughta
be able to wrap this up in 24 hours?</i>

896
01:21:01,399 --> 01:21:04,027
<i>Well, we don't really know.</i>

897
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:07,614
<i>We know we'll be into it most of the night,
probably into the early morning.</i>

898
01:21:07,697 --> 01:21:09,324
<i>We're working our way toward Willard,</i>

899
01:21:09,407 --> 01:21:11,535
<i>and we'll team up
with the National Guard over there,</i>

900
01:21:11,618 --> 01:21:13,620
<i>and then we'll be able
to give a more definite view.</i>

901
01:21:13,703 --> 01:21:15,330
<i>Thank you very much, Chief McClelland.</i>

902

<i>This is Bill Cardille, WIC TV 11 news.</i>

903
01:21:19,376 --> 01:21:21,253
<i>Thank you, Bill, for that report.</i>

904
01:21:21,378 --> 01:21:24,923
<i>Official spokesmen declined to speculate
just how long it may take</i>

905
01:21:25,006 --> 01:21:28,510
<i>to kill off all the flesh eaters
so long as the heavy ra -</i>

906
01:21:35,183 --> 01:21:38,520
- Is the fuse box in the cellar?
- I don't know. I -

907
01:21:42,023 --> 01:21:44,276
I - It isn't the fuse.

908
01:21:44,359 --> 01:21:47,404
The power lines are down.

909
01:21:49,406 --> 01:21:52,242
Helen, I have to get that gun.

910
01:21:54,202 --> 01:21:56,288
Haven't you had enough?

911
01:21:56,371 --> 01:21:59,916
Well, two people are dead already
on account of that guy.

912
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,002
Take a look out that window. Look at -

913
01:23:00,060 --> 01:23:01,686
Get over here, man!

914
01:23:03,396 --> 01:23:04,898
Come on!

915
01:23:22,123 --> 01:23:24,292
Go ahead. Go ahead.

916
01:23:24,376 --> 01:23:26,544
You wanna stay up here now?

917
01:23:26,628 --> 01:23:28,421
Helen, get in the cellar.

918
01:23:30,757 --> 01:23:32,384
Get in the cellar now. Move!

919
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:12,108
No! No!

920
01:25:16,654 --> 01:25:18,406
Karen?

921
01:25:18,490 --> 01:25:19,491
Karen?

922
01:25:23,077 --> 01:25:24,078
Karen.

923
01:25:27,415 --> 01:25:29,042
Poor baby.

924
01:25:30,919 --> 01:25:33,797
Baby.

925
01:26:19,092 --> 01:26:20,969
No! No!

926
01:26:22,595 --> 01:26:25,849
No! No! No!

927
01:26:27,433 --> 01:26:28,935
No!

928
01:26:30,270 --> 01:26:31,813
No! Get out!

929
01:26:33,982 --> 01:26:36,734
No! No, Johnny!

930
01:26:36,818 --> 01:26:39,070
No!

931
01:26:39,153 --> 01:26:41,281
No, no!

932
01:26:41,364 --> 01:26:43,783
Oh, help me, help me.

933
01:26:43,867 --> 01:26:45,368
Oh!

934
01:31:18,015 --> 01:31:19,517
Hey, Vince, Al,

935
01:31:19,600 --> 01:31:22,061
you wanna get about four or five men
and a couple dogs?

936
01:31:22,145 --> 01:31:24,147
There's a house over here
behind those trees.

937
01:31:24,230 --> 01:31:26,983
We wanna go check it out.
You still here, Bill?

938
01:31:27,066 --> 01:31:30,069
Yeah, Chief, we're going to stay with it
till we meet up with the National Guard.

939
01:31:30,153 --> 01:31:32,029
- Where'd you get the coffee?
- One of the volunteers.

940
01:31:32,113 --> 01:31:34,157
- You're doing all the work. You take it.
- Thank you.

941
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:36,659
We should be wrapped up here
about three or four more hours.

942
01:31:36,742 --> 01:31:38,369
We'll probably get into Willard then.

943
01:31:38,452 --> 01:31:40,872
I guess you can go over there
and meet the National Guard.

944
01:31:40,955 --> 01:31:43,291
Nick, you and the rest of these men
wanna come with me?

945
01:31:43,374 --> 01:31:45,543
Bill, I'm gonna check the office,
see what's happening.

946
01:31:45,626 --> 01:31:48,045
All right, Steve.
Tell 'em we're going to stay with it

947
01:31:48,129 --> 01:31:51,299
and everything appears
to be under control.

948
01:32:41,182 --> 01:32:43,476
They need you down there by the barn.

949
01:32:43,559 --> 01:32:45,061
Okay.

950
01:32:46,771 --> 01:32:49,398
Some of you guys
can follow the wagon down.

951
01:32:49,482 --> 01:32:52,318
I only need a few men
to check out the house.

952
01:32:54,987 --> 01:32:58,532
- Somebody had a cookout here, Vince.
- Yeah, sure looks like it, Con.

953
01:33:37,405 --> 01:33:39,407
He's a dead one. Get up here!

954
01:33:40,658 --> 01:33:42,660
Nick! Tony! Steve!

955
01:33:42,743 --> 01:33:45,162
You wanna get out in that field
and build me a bonfire.

956
01:33:57,466 --> 01:34:00,594
You, drag that out of here
and throw it on the fire.

957
01:34:00,678 --> 01:34:02,221
- Nothing down here.
- All right.

958
01:34:02,305 --> 01:34:04,932
Go ahead down and give 'em a hand.
Let's go check out the house.

959
01:34:05,016 --> 01:34:07,018
There's something there. I heard a noise.

960
01:34:11,689 --> 01:34:14,358
All right, Vince. Hit him in the head,
right between the eyes.

961
01:34:18,154 --> 01:34:21,240
Good shot. Okay, he's dead.
Let's go get him.

962
01:34:21,324 --> 01:34:24,493
That's another one for the fire.

963
01:34:44,388 --> 01:34:48,726
All right,
send a wagon through directly. Over.

964
01:34:53,064 --> 01:34:57,068
Keep those dogs back off of those things.

965
01:35:58,712 --> 01:36:01,382
Come ahead with the motorcycle, please.

966
01:36:01,465 --> 01:36:02,967
Let's go!

967
01:36:03,050 --> 01:36:05,094
That's the way!

968
01:36:06,387 --> 01:36:08,597
Hey, Randy,
light these torches
over here.

969
01:36:08,681 --> 01:36:10,558
Get those people in the back.
Way in the back.
